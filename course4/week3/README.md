# Week3: Classification of Text

## Objective
1. Text classification approaches comparision.
2. Naive Bayes vs SVM
3. Learn how to identify and extract features from text and transform them into feature vectors for models.

## Summary 
1. Multi-class classification vs Multi-label classfication
2. Textual features: 
    + words: remove stop words, normalization, stemming/lemmatization 
    + characteristics of words: capitalization
    + parts of speech of words in a sentence
    + grammatical structure, sentence parsing
    + grouping words of similar meaning, semantics
    + n-grams
3. naive bayes: 
   + a probabilistic model
   + assumes features are independent of each other, given the class label
   + for text classification problem, naive bayes models typically provide strong baselines
   + multinomial nv, bernoulli nv.
